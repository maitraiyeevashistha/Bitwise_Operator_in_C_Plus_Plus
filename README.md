## Aim :
*To study and implement C++ Bitwise Operators.*

##  Introduction

Bitwise operators in C++ are used to perform operations directly on the **bits** of an integer. Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representations of integers. Unlike arithmetic or logical operators that act on whole values, bitwise operators let you manipulate data at the binary level . The 1s and 0s that computers actually work with. They are useful for low-level programming tasks, such as manipulating data at the bit level or optimizing performance in critical sections of code.

##  Types of Bitwise Operators

Each operator works **bit-by-bit** on the integers.

### 1. AND (`&`) ‚Äî Bitwise AND

Performs a logical `AND` between corresponding bits of two numbers. Resulting bit is 1 only if both input bits are 1. (Returns 1 **only** if both corresponding bits are 1.)

### 2. OR (`|`):
Performs a logical OR. Resulting bit is 1 if at least one of the input bits is 1.Compares each bit of two operands; the result has a bit set to 1 if either of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1

### 3. XOR (`^`):
Performs a logical exclusive OR. Resulting bit is 1 only if the input bits are different.Compares each bit of two operands; the result has a bit set to 1 if only one of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1, but not both.

### 4. NOT (`~`):
Unary operator that inverts (flips) all bits of a number.(Inverts all the bits of the operand. Each 0 becomes 1 and each 1 becomes 0.)

### 5. Left Shift (`<<`):
Shifts all bits to the left by a specified number of positions, inserting 0s on the right. Equivalent to multiplying by powers of 2.

### 6. Right Shift (`>>`):
Shifts all bits to the right. Useful for dividing integers by powers of 2.

## Summary of the programs 

### Program 1 : Bitwise Operator 

This program demonstrates how the bitwise AND, OR, NOT, XOR, left shift, and right shift work on two integers.

 - `AND` returns 1 only if both bits are 1.
 - `OR` returns 1 if at least one bit is 1.
 - `XOR` returns 1 if the bits are different.
 - `NOT` flips each bit (used for one's complement).
 - `Left` Shift multiplies a number by 2‚Åø.
 - `Right` Shift divides a number by 2‚Åø.
 
### Sample Output:
Enter the bit position to be set: 5
Enter the bit position to be reset: 3
Your number is:56
Your number is:16
## üîß Program 2: Set and Reset Specific Bits

This program illustrates how to **manipulate individual bits** of an integer using bitwise operations ‚Äî specifically, how to **set** or **reset** (clear) a specific bit. These techniques are fundamental in system-level programming where memory efficiency and control over hardware states are crucial.

### üõ†Ô∏è Setting a Bit
To **set** a specific bit in a number, we use the **bitwise OR (`|`)** operator along with a **bitmask**.  
A bitmask is a binary number where only the target bit is `1` and all others are `0`.

For example, if you want to set bit position 3:
```cpp
int mask = 1 << 3;
number = number | mask;
